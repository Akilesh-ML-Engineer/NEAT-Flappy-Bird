# NEAT Flappy Bird

## Overview

This project implements the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm to train an AI agent to play the popular game Flappy Bird. NEAT is a genetic algorithm designed to evolve artificial neural networks.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how NEAT can be used to train an AI agent to play Flappy Bird by evolving neural networks to perform well in the game.

## Requirements

- Python - 3.11
- Pygame
- NEAT Python
